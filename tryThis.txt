Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for glossBitmaps-0.1.0.0:
    base-4.11.1.0 from stack configuration does not match >=4.8 && <4.9  (latest matching version is 4.8.2.0)
    gloss-1.12.0.0 from stack configuration does not match >=1.13 && <1.14  (latest matching version is 1.13.0.1)
needed since glossBitmaps is a build target.

Some different approaches to resolving this:

  * Set 'allow-newer: true' to ignore all version constraints and build anyway.

  * Consider trying 'stack solver', which uses the cabal-install solver to attempt to find some working build
    configuration. This can be convenient when dealing with many complicated constraint errors, but results may be
    unpredictable.

  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps in /home/mikeh/glossBitmaps/stack.yaml:

- base-4.8.2.0
- gloss-1.13.0.1
